### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## Welcome To My Personal Repository! 

My name is Siddharth Arya, although I go by Sid.

Currently Working on: 
1. Getting comfortable with full-stack development using Javascript (MERN stack for the most part)
2. Getting into ML (I only just started, I literally just know how linear and logistic regression works...)

Feel free to check out my projects and contact me through LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/in/siddharth-arya-4b417324a
