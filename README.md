### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

## Welcome To My Personal Repository! 

My name is Siddharth Arya, although I go by Sid. I am currently pursuing a Backelors of Science in Computer Science at the University of Toronto.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a project collaborater at the Vector Insitute. Our research involves post Deployment Model Monitering. Specifically, when we deploy a model, we need to moniter its performance against data that we don't have labels for. Auxilliary methods are required here in order to ensure reliability on model predictions. Check out *Projects* below to see the Pypi package we recently released on our method! 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about MLOPS, specifically integrating MLFlow with Azure Machine Learning for seemless experiment tracking and Model deployment

## Projects:

Currently a short list, its always hard to take a project to a point where you feel proud of it to announce it to other people, I'm working on it!

1) Contributer to [bayesian_dpddm](https://pypi.org/project/bayesian-dpddm/), a published python module to help users validate their deployed machine learning model against unlabled test data, in order to determine wether your models predictions are reliable. The associated github is pinned below!
